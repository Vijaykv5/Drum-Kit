## Hey ðŸ‘‹
I learned this project from **Angela Yu Course**. <br><br>
This Project was implemented 80% using **Javascript** and rest using **HTML** and **CSS**
<br><br>
**Javascript**- The Concept used here is Adding Eventlistener to respective buttons, getting each alphabet you clicked by the usage of "Onclick()" Eventlistener 
and Navigating each button through a swich case. The Keyboard event property is also used to make sounds while clicking respective keys 
<br>
<br>
 **Note :**
 you can make sounds by clicking the corresponding buttons as well as pressing it your keyboard .
 
 Thank you :)
